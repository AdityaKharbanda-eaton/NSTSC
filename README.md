This is the repository for the paper "[Neuro-symbolic Models for Interpretable Time Series Classification using Temporal Logic Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09114)", which is a neuro-symbolic model that leverages signal temporal logic and neural network to classify time series data and learn a human-readable, interpretable formula as explanation.
